# Picshare
## A Flutter social network prototype for learning reasons

Hello, world!  
I'm Vitor Allace, i'm a Computer Science student from IFGOIANO - Morrinhos, and this is Picshare, my flutter social network project that ive developed only for learning reasons!

### How to run?
This code was made using `Flutter 3.10.6` and `JDK 19`.  
All the application was implemented and tested using Windows 10 desktop mode.  
Linux users needs to install the dependencies:
  ```
    sudo apt install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
  ```
Obs: its still incomplete on linux, file_picker is not working for some reason...
  
  `Note 1: this project is still in development, this isnt the final version of Picshare! Everything here, including the application name, can be changed along the development time`  

  `Note 2: every single picture here, isn't mine, they are used here just for test reasons and is not planned to go for the final version`
